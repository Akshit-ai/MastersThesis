# Week 01 Progress
📌 Week 1 — Project Setup & Understanding Requirements
- Understood the thesis objectives: integrating sensors into a vehicle model in CARLA and connecting them to ROS2.
- Installed and configured Ubuntu environment for the thesis workflow.
- Installed CARLA simulator and verified that the default examples run correctly.
- Studied basic ROS2 concepts (nodes, topics, TF, packages).
- Understood the overall architecture: CARLA → ros-bridge → ROS2 workspace → visualization.

📌 Week 2 — URDF/Xacro Learning & Vehicle Model Planning
- Researched URDF and XACRO file structure for describing robot/vehicle models.
- Understood the concept of a base_link representing the vehicle frame.
- Started designing the BMW M8 research vehicle model using URDF.
- Identifing required sensor frames
- Learning how transforms work (static transform publisher, TF tree).
- Created initial folder structure for ROS2 package.
